# WIFI-Extractor
This simple Python script will extract WIFI SSID and Password.

This requires no external libaries. It only uses "subprocess" module.
This only works with WIFIs you have already connected to. So it's only useful if you just want to get the SSID and password if you've forgotten.
The output will be stored in a textfile called "wifiInfo".
